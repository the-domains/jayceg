Exteriors

Twilight architectural photography is achieved by taking multiple exposures and combining them to create the most flattering image.

Each image highlights a certain architectural feature.

Many single exposure images struggle to capture the unique detail of a home or structure the way twilight images do.

By taking the picture during the "blue hour" all the way to sunset, the light on the exterior can be balanced with the light coming from the interior. Most twilight shoots take between 30 minutes to two hours to make.

Twilight exteriors can take up to 100 individual photos to make one final image.

The photos are captured with a tilt-shift lens which allows for distortion correction and the most true-to-shape view of a building.

Utilizing specialized lighting equipment and remote camera tethering allows for pinpoint accuracy and customization of the image.

After all the work is done, the result is a beautiful premiere image for the front page of a real estate listing, a contractor's portfolio, or a remodeler's showcase.
